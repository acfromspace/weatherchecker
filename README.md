[_weatherchecker_](https://weatherchecker.netlify.com) is a website with the following features:

- **Calls to the Open Weather API.** The [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) is simple, clear and free for those wanting to seek data of weather forecasts whether it be current forecasts, 5 days, or even 16 days. There are other available APIs so check them out!

- **Styled with Bootstrap.** [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.

- **Hosted with Netlify.** [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) offers both web-based and command-line interfaces in order to adapt to an extremely easy and intuitive user interface dependent on the user.

The project uses external services.

```

1. **`public/`**: What is distributed to the viewing software so everyone can see your greatest creation!
2. **`src/`**: All development usually occurs here. `src` is a convention for “source code”.
3. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells `.git` which files it should not track nor maintain a version history for. For instance, you shouldn't let anyone get your `.env` files. (These usually contain your API keys)
4. **`LICENSE`**: An open source license that protects contributors and users depending on the license chosen.
5. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) projects, which includes metadata (the project’s name, author, package names, etc.). This manifest is how [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) knows which packages to install for your project.
6. **`README.md`**: A markdown file containing useful reference information about your project. The file you're reading right now!
7. **`yarn.lock`**: This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your package manager dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly)

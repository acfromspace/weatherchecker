[*weatherchecker*](https://weatherchecker.netlify.com) is a weather application with the following features:

- **Calls to the Open Weather API.** The [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) is simple, clear and free for those wanting to seek data of weather forecasts whether it be current forecasts, 5 days, or even 16 days. There are other available APIs so check them out!

- **Styled with Bootstrap.** [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery. 

- **Hosted with Netlify.** [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) offers both web-based and command-line interfaces in order to adapt to an extremely easy and intuitive user interface dependent on the user.

6. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) projects, which includes metadata (the project’s name, author, package names, etc.). This manifest is how [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) knows which packages to install for your project.

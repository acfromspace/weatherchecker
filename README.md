[*weatherchecker*](https://weatherchecker.netlify.com) is a weather application with the following features:

- **Calls to the Open Weather API.** The [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) is simple, clear and free for those wanting to seek data of weather forecasts whether it be current forecasts, 5 days, or even 16 days. There are other available APIs so check them out!

- **Styled with Bootstrap.** [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery. 

- **Hosted with Netlify.** [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) offers both web-based and command-line interfaces in order to adapt to an extremely easy and intuitive user interface dependent on the user.

  1.  **`/node_modules`**: The directory where all of the modules of  code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.  

  2.  **`/public`**: What the user sees if pondering your website.

  3.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser), like your site header, or a page template. “src” is a convention for “source code”.
  
  4.  **`.editorconfig`**: [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs
  
  5.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for. For instance, you shouldn't let anyone get your `.env` files (These usually contain your password and such to speak with APIs).
  
  6.  **`LICENSE`**: This project is licensed under the MIT license.
  
  7.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
  
  8.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project. The one you're reading right now!
  
  9. **`yarn.lock`**: This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly)

<!-- FEATURES -->

*weatherchecker* is a:

<!-- - **Blazing fast loading thanks to Gatsby.** Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps, so you can create high-quality, dynamic web apps, from blogs to ecommerce sites to user dashboards.

- **Customizability.** Within the "src" folder, all adaptable files to be made by the user are available. One can even go further to possibly add in aesthetic javascript node packages to add visuals.

- **Hosted with Netlify.** Don't get me wrong, GitHub Pages offers great utility for first timers, but as I experienced more with web hosts, I needed something more reliable and easier to use. Netlify offers both web-based and command-line interfaces in order to adapt to an extremely easy and intuitive user interface dependent on the user. -->

  1.  **`/node_modules`**: The directory where all of the modules of  code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.  
  
  2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser), like your site header, or a page template. “Src” is a convention for “source code”.

  3. **`/static`**: The directory where HTML dependencies lie. Normally the `favicon.ico` (the image next to the title in the browser tab), goes here.

  4.  **`.babelrc`**: This file enables to write modern JavaScript that will be "transpiled" to widely-supported Javascript. Think of it as a language translator for all devices that will see your website.
  
  5.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for. For instance, you shouldn't let anyone get your `.env` files (These usually contain your password and such to speak with APIs).
  
  6.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for a tool called [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), which is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.
  
  7.  **`.travis.yml`**: This file runs your program's tests every time you commit to GitHub. Point of this is discover right away if a commit broke something and to fix it before it becomes a problem. Imagine snapping the gauntlet if you didn't have all 6 stones! This warns you before creating poor decisions.
  
  8.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).
  
  9.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby node APIs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. This project contains none, but the file remains if one wishes to build blog posts or of the sort.
  
  10.  **`LICENSE`**: This project is licensed under the MIT license.
  
  11.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly).
  
  12.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
  
  13.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project. The one you're reading right now! -->
